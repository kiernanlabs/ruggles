Some overlaps, like the forearm crossing, could use cleaner decisive marks.","After rough-in, go over the final contours with a single confident pass, erasing ghost lines to clarify the silhouette.; Vary pressure—thicker lines for foreground edges (nearest arm), lighter for receding or interior details—to create depth.; Use long, continuous curves for the hair and jacket seams instead of short feathered strokes to communicate material flow.",12,13,1,"The head feels three-dimensional thanks to the centerline and eyeline wrap, and the hair strands follow volume, yet the torso and sleeves are mostly outlined without internal shading cues, leaving the figure somewhat flat.","Add simple cross-contour lines or light shading along the arms and jacket folds to sell cylindrical form.; Indicate the plane break between front and side of the face with subtle value changes around cheekbones and jaw.; Suggest light source direction with a few cast shadows—e.g., under the chin onto the collar—to anchor the figure in space.",16,15,-1,"The raised brows, gentle smile, and self-contained pose quickly convey friendliness and confidence. Flowing hair lines support an easygoing mood, though deeper value contrasts or background context could heighten atmosphere.","Slightly tilt the head or shoulders to add more personality and dynamism to the stance.; Push contrast in key features—darker pupils, accentuated lip line—to draw attention to the expression.; Consider a soft vignette or suggestive background shapes to reinforce the character’s environment and emotional tone."

The lower body is only blocked-in, so the full structural rhythm of the pose is missing.","Start each figure with simple gesture and mannequin shapes (egg for rib cage, box for pelvis, cylinders for limbs) to check relative sizes before adding details.; Use a vertical plumb line down the center of the figure and lightly mark head-length units to keep torso, pelvis, and legs proportionate.; Study photo references of crossed-arm poses; note how elbows usually align with the waist and how the upper‐arm length compares to head height.",14,7,-7,"Lines vary in darkness but are mostly short, scratchy strokes that create clutter rather than clear form. Confident contour lines around the face and hair show promise, yet many interior construction marks remain visible and unresolved.","Commit to long, sweeping strokes for major contours; save short hatch marks for texture only after the outline feels secure.; Use a hierarchy of pressure: light for construction, medium for final contour, dark for cast shadows—then erase the light scaffolding.; Practice timed gesture drawings with a blunt pencil or pen to force cleaner, economy-of-line decisions.",10,6,-4,"The face contains some tonal variation and the hair has volume, but the torso and arms read as flat masses of hatch marks without a consistent light source. Crossing arms should wrap visibly around a cylindrical chest, yet that underlying form is missing.","Choose a clear light direction and shade planes according to it; reserve the darkest tones for true cast shadows under arms and chin.; Model limbs with simple 3-D primitives (cylinders) first, then wrap shading around them to show roundness.; Separate value ranges: mid-tones for local color, darker tones for occlusion, and a few highlights left as paper to suggest sheen and depth.",15,10,-5,"The slight tilt of the head, raised brows, and soft smile give the character a friendly, self-assured vibe. However, inconsistent shading and incomplete background make the emotional atmosphere feel undeveloped.",Accentuate facial expression with clearer value contrasts around the eyes and mouth to draw viewer focus.; Echo the character’s attitude in body language—tilt the shoulders or hips subtly to reinforce relaxed confidence.; Consider a minimal background tone or vignette to frame the figure and unify the mood without overworking the drawing.

The torso cylinder was lightly built in, but the pelvis and ribcage volumes don’t align cleanly, so the pose feels slightly disjointed.",Block in two simple boxes (ribcage and pelvis) connected by a flexible spine before adding limbs; this will anchor the proportions.; Use quick reference thumbnails of a galloping horse to check relative leg lengths and joint angles.; Add a center-line down the torso and head to keep the body parts oriented in the same perspective.,10,9,-1,"Lines vary between light construction strokes and darker defining lines, but many contours remain hesitant and scratchy. Cross-contour marks are tentative, and overlaps (such as at the withers and haunch) aren’t cleanly stated, which muddles the form.","Commit to a single decisive contour after the sketch phase—erase or lighten the construction scribbles beneath.; Experiment with tapering strokes: begin lines with more pressure, ease up, then finish with a sharp point to suggest fur direction and muscle tension.; Introduce line-weight hierarchy: heavier lines for forms closest to the viewer, lighter for those receding.",11,8,-3,"Some subtle shading around the neck and limbs hints at three-dimensionality, yet most areas are filled with flat color passes (orange and red) that don’t follow the surface planes. The body reads more like an outline colored in rather than a fully modeled mass.","Shade along the cross-contours of each muscle group (especially barrel, shoulder, and haunch) to wrap tone around the form.; Identify a single light source and gradually layer graphite from light to dark to build volume instead of filling with parallel scribbles.; Use reflected light on the underside of the belly and inner legs to separate overlapping volumes.",15,12,-3,"The angled pose, wind-swept mane, and bright horn introduce a playful, energetic mood, and the red streaks suggest vitality or motion lines. However, the facial expression and background are underdeveloped, limiting emotional impact.",Accent the eyes and ear direction to bolster character—wide eyes and pinned-back ears can heighten excitement.; Add dust clouds or motion blur lines around the hooves to amplify the sense of speed.; Consider a subtle background gradient or color splash to set an atmosphere without overwhelming the figure.
